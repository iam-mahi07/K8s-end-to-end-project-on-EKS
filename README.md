# Kubernetes end-to-end project on Amazon EKS :rocket::cloud:

ðŸŽ¯ This repo would help you to gain a practical hands-on experience on how to deploy a web application on AWS EKS using Kubernetes. I promise!

# Project Title & Description :pencil:

Title: Deploying a 2048 Game Application on Amazon EKS with ALB using Kubernetes.

Description: This project demonstrates the deployment of a containerized web application (2048 game) on AWS using Kubernetes and EKS, with ALB for traffic management. Integrated IAM roles for secure access and utilized AWS Fargate for serverless pod management.

# Tools & Technologies Used :hammer_and_wrench::gear::computer:

1. AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

2. Kubernetes (for managing containers and pods).

3. AWS Load Balancer Controller (for managing Application Load Balancers).

4. Fargate (serverless compute engine).

5. IAM Roles & Policies (for secure access and management).

6. kubectl, eksctl, AWS CLI (for command-line interaction).

# Key Achievements :1st_place_medal:

1. Deployed a scalable web application using Kubernetes on AWS EKS, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

2. Configured ALB (Application Load Balancer) to route traffic to the Kubernetes service, optimizing load distribution across pods.

3. Implemented IAM roles and policies to secure the AWS resources, ensuring least-privileged access for Kubernetes workloads.

4. Leveraged AWS Fargate to run pods without managing underlying EC2 instances, reducing infrastructure management overhead.

# Let's jump into the practical now!! :mag_right:

ðŸ“Œ Follow these steps after the prerequisites are setup.

# Step-1: Installation of EKS

:bulb: Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that eliminates the need to manage the underlying instances. With Fargate, you specify your application's resource needs, and AWS automatically provisions, scales, and maintains the infrastructure. This option is ideal for users who prioritize ease-of-use and want to concentrate on application development and deployment rather than managing infrastructure.

:bulb: This step creates an EKS cluster using a Fargate (serverless approach instead of EC2 instances), it automatically creates all the Stack with the help CloudFormation that's required for the cluster to operate. You can install or setup the EKS cluster with the help of EC2 instances as well, it's upto you to choose which one based on the requirement. 

To find the below steps, please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html

i) Install EKS cluster using Fargate

```
eksctl create cluster --name "cluster-name" --region "region-name" --fargate
```

# Step-2: Configuration of IAM OIDC identity provider

:bulb: This step creates an IAM OIDC identity provider, enabling the ALB controller to securely interact with AWS resources by integrating with IAM. 

To find the below steps. please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html

i) To create an IAM OIDC identity provider for your cluster with eksctl:
```
oidc_id=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name $cluster_name --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text | cut -d '/' -f 5) 
```
ii) To determine whether an IAM OIDC provider with your cluster's issuer ID is already in your account ( means check if there's an IAM OIDC provider configured already).
```
aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers | grep $oidc_id | cut -d "/" -f4
```
If nothing is found, then create one;
```
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster $cluster_name --approve
```

# Step-3: Creation of IAM policy and IAM Role

:bulb: First, create an IAM policy with all necessary permissions (e.g., to manage load balancers) and then create an IAM role, attach the policy to it, and associate this IAM role with the IAM service account.

:bulb: This step creates an IAM service account in your EKS cluster's kube-system namespace, attaches a role with the necessary AWS Load Balancer Controller permissions (policy), and links it to your cluster to interact with AWS resources securely, in specific to our case to manage load balancers (Application Load Balancer in our case) for applications (web app - 2048 in our case).

ðŸ“Œ NOTE: You only need to create an IAM Role for the AWS Load Balancer Controller one per AWS account. Check if AmazonEKSLoadBalancerControllerRole exists in the IAM Console. If the role exists, skip to Step-4 (Install AWS Load Balancer Controller).

To find the below steps, please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/lbc-helm.html

i) Download IAM policy for the AWS Load Balancer Controller that allows it to make calls to AWS APIs on your behalf.
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5.4/docs/install/iam_policy.json
```
ii) Create IAM policy using the policy downloaded in the previous step:
```
aws iam create-policy --policy-name AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --policy-document file://iam_policy.json
```
iii) To create IAM Role:
```
eksctl create iamserviceaccount --cluster=<your-cluster-name> --namespace=kube-system --name=aws-load-balancer-controller --role-name AmazonEKSLoadBalancerControllerRole --attach-policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::<your-aws-account-id>:policy/AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --approve
```

# Step-4: Installation of AWS Load Balancer Controller

ðŸ’¡ This step creates an Ingress controller ( you can call it as AWS Load Balancer Controller or ALB controller) that reads/watches the Ingress resource and creates an Application Load Balancer (address) through which we can access the application and, creating an Ingress would be of no use without an Ingress controller. The target groups, listeners and rules, security groups and everything that's required for the load balancer is taken care by the Ingress Controller itself.

ðŸ“Œ NOTE: Before executing the helm commands to install ALB controller, first install helm on windows to perform the helm commands. 

Reference for Helm download: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-the-binary-releases

# Installation of helm 

i) Commands (you can choose any one of the commands from below)

a) Using -o in the command will help to get a desired name to the file after downloading onto the terminal/server

```
curl -o my-helm.zip https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.16.1-windows-amd64.zip
```

b) Using -O in the command helps to download the binary file with the original name

```
curl -O https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.16.1-windows-amd64.zip
```

c) Using -sLO in the command helps, -s makes curl silent, -L follows redirects, and -O saves the file with its original name.

```
curl -sLO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.16.1-windows-amd64.zip
```

ii) Unzip the binary and move to bin directory to make it executable

```
unzip helm-v3.16.1-windows-amd64.zip -d $HOME/bin
```

# Download using binary to local machine

i) You can directly download the helm binary.
```
https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.16.1-windows-amd64.zip
```
ii) Once it's downloaded in your local machine, unzip the binary and extract the file.

iii) Move the helm file to the bin folder for the binary file can be executed. The binary moved to bin acts as a "helm cli" and the helm commands can be be performed. 

```
mv helm.exe $HOME/bin
```
iv) Type helm and hit enter, if you get the commands related to helm, then helm is installed and you can proceed with the below mentioned steps.


To find the below steps, please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/lbc-helm.html

i) To add the eks-charts Helm chart repo: 
```
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
```
If using Windows PowerShell, first install chocolatey package manager and then install Helm using the command 
```
choco install kubernetes-helm
```
ii) To update the helm repo (to make sure that you have the most recent charts): 
```
helm repo update eks
```
# To install AWS ALB Controller

i) Create ALB using the helm
```
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller -n kube-system --set clusterName=<your-cluster-name> --set serviceAccount.create=false --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller --set region=<region> --set vpcId=<your-vpc-id>
```
ii) To verify that the controller is installed and running
```
kubectl get deployment -n kube-system aws-load-balancer-controller
```

# Step-5: To deploy the application

:bulb: In this step, we create a Fargate profile inside a cluster within a desired region to deploy the application. We also, create an isolated namespace, deployment, service, ingress, and, ingress controller creates a load balancer through which we access the application.

To find the below steps, please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html

i) To deploy using Fargate, create a Fargate profile. You can create the profile by running the following command.
```
eksctl create fargateprofile --cluster <cluster-name> --region <region-code> --name alb-sample-app --namespace game-2048
```
ii) Now deploy the game application by running the following command
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7.2/docs/examples/2048/2048_full.yaml
```
:bulb: This manifest sets up a Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and Ingress for the game-2048 namespace, creating the necessary resources to deploy and expose the game-2048 application within the cluster. It includes the creation of a service named service-2048 that exposes the deployment on port 80, and an Ingress resource named ingress-2048 that defines routing rules for incoming HTTP traffic and annotations for an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB).

# Step-6: Cleanup Resources

:bulb: This step is to delete the resources (created by kubectl) after you finish experimenting with your sample application, delete it by running one of the the following commands.

To find the below steps, please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html

i) If you applied the manifest, rather than applying a copy that you downloaded, use the following command.

```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.7.2/docs/examples/2048/2048_full.yaml
```
ii) If you downloaded and edited the manifest, use the following command.
```
kubectl delete -f 2048_full.yaml
```

# Step-7: Deletion of EKS Cluster

:bulb: This step deletes the entire infrastructure that's created by the EKS cluster using the eksctl.

i) Delete the EKS cluster

```
eksctl delete cluster --name "cluster-name" --region "region-name"
```
